# cpp-practice
This is a repository that is being created to document my c++ learning journey as I learn about the ins and out's of the language. This repository is created to upload all my minor projects that document my c++ language learning journey.
I have been learning c++ language in from many sources so please do undertand all these projects that I upload are for practice reasons.
Also the c++ language projects that I upload here might be the same as you find in someone's videos or many other sources so please do keep in mind that these projects are all for practice and so as these projects may bear a resemblance to someone's code. Pls be nice :)
Thanks and Namaste. :))
